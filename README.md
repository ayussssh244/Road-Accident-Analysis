ðŸš— Road Safety Insights with Tableau! ðŸ“Š

Excited to share my latest Road Accident Analysis Dashboard, built using Tableau with 600,000+ rows of real-world data! ðŸš¦

This interactive dashboard provides deep insights into road accident trends, helping to identify high-risk areas, fatality causes, and yearly accident patterns. Hereâ€™s what I worked on:

âœ… Geospatial Mapping: Visualized 1,000+ accident hotspots across the UK using Tableau Maps.

âœ… Trend & Severity Analysis: Tracked YoY changes, revealing an 11.7% decrease in total accidents and a 26.4% drop in fatal casualties.

âœ… Dynamic Filters & Parameters: Enabled custom analysis with filters for year, severity, weather conditions, and road types.

âœ… Performance Optimization: Reduced dashboard load time by 40% with LOD expressions and data extracts.

âœ… ETL & Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned 600K+ records using SQL & Python for accurate visualization.

ðŸ’¡ This project enhances data-driven decision-making for road safety authorities, helping to mitigate accidents and improve traffic policies.
